# sorting_visualiser

This repository contains all of the code required to run my sorting visualiser project in Python.

The sorting algorithms include: bubble sort, selection sort, quick sort and merge sort.

I decide on this project as I was curious on how these types of algorithms run and how their time complexity compares froma visual point of view. 

The more complicated algorithms such as merge and quick sort run recursively and are difficult to picture in your head and can be fiddley to index correctly so this has given me good practice in this type of algorithm design.

During this project I also was able to practice object oriented design to streamline the code which is something I am learning to handle more and more.
